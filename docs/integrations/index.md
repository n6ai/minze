Since Minze is build on top of Web Components and doesn't rely on a specific framework, it can be integrated into a variety of different workflows.

Have a look at the [Installation Guide](/guide/installation) if you want to integrate Minze into your workflow, or browse the available integration guides to integrate other tools into the Minze dev environment.
