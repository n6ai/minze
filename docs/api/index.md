# API

All publicly intended API methods, properties and types can be found under their respective sections.

In this reference, the term `component` usually refers to the JavaScript instance of the web component, while the term `element` refers to the DOM representation of the web component, but both mean pretty much the same thing and are sometimes used interchangeably.
