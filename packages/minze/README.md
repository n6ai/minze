# Minze

> Dead-simple JS framework for native web components.

Minze (German shorthand for "Peppermint", pronounced [/ËˆmÉªntÍ¡sÉ™/](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/De-Minze.ogg)) lets you rapidly build native web components.

It provides an intuitive abstraction layer around the web components API with its own fully typed [JavaScript API](https://minze.dev/api/). Including reactivity, lifecycle hooks, scoped styles, one-shot components registration, and more.

1. You can create cross-framework component libraries or design systems and share them with your team or the world.
2. You can add Minze to any web project and create components without even using any build tools.
